Plashr Privacy Policy
=====================

**Effective Date:** 10/28/2025

Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how we handle data within the Plashr mobile
application, an Unsplash client developed by Rick Muigo. By using Plashr, you are consenting to the
practices described in this document.

### Personal Information

Plashr is designed to be a private and secure experience. The app does not collect, store, or
transmit any information that can be used to identify you personally, such as your name, email
address, or phone number.

### Third-Party Services

The app's primary function is to provide an interface for the Unsplash platform. As such, Plashr
integrates with several external services that operate under their own terms and privacy policies.
We encourage you to review some of these services' privacy policies before using our app.

* **Unsplash:** The content you view in the app is provided by Unsplash. Their data collection
  practices are outlined in the [Unsplash Privacy Policy](https://unsplash.com/privacy).

* **Google Services:** Plashr relies on foundational Android services, which are subject
  to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

* **Firebase Analytics:** To better understand how the app is used and to improve its features, we use
  Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage data. This information is not personally identifiable and
  is handled according to the [Google Firebase Privacy Policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).

* **Firebase Crashlytics:** To ensure the app runs smoothly, we use this service to receive reports
  on technical issues. This data is entirely anonymous and is used exclusively for app improvement.
  The policy is available in
  the [Google Firebase Privacy Policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).

### App Analytics and Diagnostics

In the event of an app malfunction, we may collect anonymous diagnostic data. This data, which helps
us identify and fix bugs, includes technical details about your device and the app's state at the
time of the error. This information is not linked to your identity and is used for internal analysis
only. We also collect anonymous analytics data to understand user engagement and improve the app experience.

### Data Security

We are dedicated to safeguarding your information. While we implement a range of security measures,
it is important to acknowledge that no method of electronic storage or transmission can be
guaranteed as 100% secure.

### External Links

Plashr may contain links to external websites, such as social media platforms. We have no control
over the content or privacy policies of these external sites and are not responsible for them. We
recommend reviewing their privacy statements before providing any information.

### Policy Updates

This privacy policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in our practices. We will notify
you of any modifications by posting the new policy within the app and on this page.
